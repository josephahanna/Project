# Project
This Arduino-based project is designed to control a two-wheeled robot utilizing a Pixy camera for color recognition and a tachometer for speed measurement. The robot's behavior is influenced by the colors red, yellow, and green detected by the camera; on detecting red, it halts, while yellow triggers a slow speed, and green commands a maximum speed. The motor speed, in RPM and m/s, along with the elapsed time since the program's inception, are continuously monitored and displayed. Additionally, an estimation of the distance to the detected color-coded objects is calculated based on the objects' height in the camera image, providing further information that could be used for navigation or object interaction. Through the integration of color recognition, speed monitoring, and distance estimation, this project lays the groundwork for a responsive robotic system capable of reacting to visual cues in its environment.
